**Sparkline SVG** is simple, zero-dependency, Elixir library to generate SVG sparkline charts.

[Online documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/sparkline_svg)

## Overview

A [sparkline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) is a small, simple chart that is drawn
without axes or coordinates. It presents the general shape of the variation of a dataset at a
glance.

Sparkline SVG allows you to create a sparkline chart from various data shapes and show the dots,
the line, and the area under the line. You can also add markers to the chart to highlight
specific spots. You can also show common reference lines.

The library is highly customizable and allows you to use CSS to style the chart as well as keyword
options.

### Datapoints

Datapoints are the values that will be used to draw the chart. They can be:
- A **list of numbers**, where each number is a value for the y axis.
- A **list of tuples** with two values. The first value is the x axis and the second value is
  the y axis.

### Markers

Markers are used to highlight specific spots on the chart. There are two types of markers:
- A single marker that will be rendered as a vertical line.
- A range marker that will be rendered as a rectangle.

### Reference lines

Reference lines are used to show common reference lines on the chart. There are four types of
currently supported reference lines (maximum, minimum, average, and median) that will be rendered
as horizontal lines.

### Customization

Sparkline SVG allows you to customize the chart showing or hiding the dots, the line, and the area
under the line. There are two ways to customize the chart:
- Using the options like color or width.
- Using the CSS classes option to give classes to SVG elements and then using CSS to style them.

### Usage example

``` elixir
# Datapoints and general options
datapoints = [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]
options = [width: 100, height: 40]

# A very simple line chart
sparkline = SparklineSvg.new(datapoints, options)

# Display what you want
line_options = [width: 0.25, color: "black"]
sparkline = SparklineSvg.show_line(sparkline, line_options)

# Render the chart to an SVG string
{:ok, svg} = SparklineSvg.to_svg(sparkline)
```

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `:sparkline_svg` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sparkline_svg, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Status

This library is currently under active development and itâ€™s API is likely to change.

## Examples

### A cyan sparkline with a line, area, and markers

``` elixir
# Data source
data = [4, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 11, 11, 5, 7, 6, 9, 19, 19, 20, 21, 20, 17, 20, 19, 17]

# Arbitrary marker and marker area
marker = 25
marker_area = {10, 15}

data
|> SparklineSvg.new(smoothing: 0.05)
|> SparklineSvg.show_line(color: "rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.5)", width: 0.4)
|> SparklineSvg.show_area(color: "rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.2)")
|> SparklineSvg.add_marker(marker, stroke_color: "rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.8)", stroke_width: 0.4)
|> SparklineSvg.add_marker(marker_area, stroke_color: "rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.4)", stroke_width: 0.4, fill_color: "rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.2)")
|> SparklineSvg.to_svg!()
```

|> SparklineSvg.new(width: 200, height: 30, smoothing: 0)
|> SparklineSvg.show_line(color: "rgba(40, 255, 118, 0.8)", width: 0.4)
|> SparklineSvg.show_area(color: "rgba(40, 255, 118, 0.4)")
|> SparklineSvg.to_svg!()
```
